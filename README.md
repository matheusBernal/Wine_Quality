#Real Estate Valuation

This project leverages the real estate valuation dataset collected from the Sindian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, to develop and evaluate various machine learning models for property price prediction. Using simple linear regression as a starting point, I created several models, compared their performance, and selected the best-performing algorithms. These selected models were then used to generate predictions for the target column (property prices).

I further enriched the dataset by adding new columns representing the variation values derived from the top algorithms, and exported the final dataset as a CSV file. This dataset was later used to build an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing insightful visualizations of the real estate market trends.
